## About <a name = "about"></a>

I created this application to satisfy a need I had in 2019, which was trying to manage my tasks I had pending and get more responsible.
This app was built using some web development technologies such as: HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
I used localstorage to try to simulate a database and save all the information about my pending tasks.

Once you clicked on the button, you will get a notification that tells you that the task was added successfully and your task will show up in the list as a pending task.
